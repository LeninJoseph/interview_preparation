# Memory Management in Python

Memory management in Python involves the allocation and deallocation of memory to ensure efficient use of resources. Python uses an automatic memory management system, which includes:

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Reference Counting**
- Python tracks the number of references to an object.
- When the reference count drops to zero, the memory is deallocated.

### 2. **Garbage Collection**
- Python has a garbage collector to handle cyclic references (e.g., objects referencing each other).
- The garbage collector identifies and frees memory occupied by unreachable objects.

### 3. **Memory Allocation**
- Python uses private heaps to store objects and data structures.
- The `PyObject` allocator manages memory for Python objects.

### 4. **Memory Optimization**
- Python uses techniques like **interning** for small integers and strings to save memory.
- Modules like `gc` and `sys` provide tools to monitor and optimize memory usage.

## Best Practices
- Avoid creating unnecessary objects.
- Use built-in data structures efficiently.
- Explicitly delete large objects when no longer needed using `del`.


## Types of Memory in Python

### 1. **Stack Memory**
- Used for function calls and local variables.
- Memory is automatically allocated and deallocated as functions are called and return.
- Operates in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner.

### 2. **Heap Memory**
- Used for dynamic memory allocation.
- Objects and data structures are stored in the heap.
- Managed by Python's memory manager and garbage collector.

### 3. **Static Memory**
- Used for global variables and static data.
- Allocated at the start of the program and deallocated when the program ends.

Understanding these memory types helps in writing efficient and optimized Python code.
