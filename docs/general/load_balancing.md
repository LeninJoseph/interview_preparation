# Load Balancing

Load balancing is the process of distributing network or application traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance. It helps prevent overloading a single server and improves the availability of services.

## Key Benefits
- **Scalability**: Handles increased traffic by adding more servers.
- **High Availability**: Ensures minimal downtime by redirecting traffic during server failures.
- **Improved Performance**: Reduces latency by balancing the load efficiently.

## Types of Load Balancing
1. **DNS Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic using DNS records.
2. **Hardware Load Balancers**: Dedicated devices for traffic distribution.
3. **Software Load Balancers**: Applications like HAProxy or NGINX.
4. **Cloud Load Balancers**: Managed services like AWS ELB or Azure Load Balancer.

## Load Balancing Algorithms
- **Round Robin**: Distributes requests sequentially.
- **Least Connections**: Sends traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hash**: Routes requests based on client IP.
- **Weighted Round Robin**: Assigns weights to servers for proportional traffic distribution.

## Common Tools
- **HAProxy**
- **NGINX**
- **Traefik**
- **AWS Elastic Load Balancer**
- **Azure Load Balancer**

## Use Cases
- Web applications with high traffic.
- Distributed systems requiring fault tolerance.
- Microservices architecture.

## Challenges
- Proper configuration to avoid bottlenecks.
- Handling session persistence (sticky sessions).
- Monitoring and scaling dynamically.
