# Authentication and Authorization

## Introduction
Authentication and authorization are critical components of modern application security. While they are often used together, they serve distinct purposes in ensuring secure access to systems and data.

## Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that the entity attempting to access a resource is who they claim to be.

### Common Authentication Methods
1. **Password-Based Authentication**: Users provide a username and password.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Combines two or more factors:
    - Something you know (password)
    - Something you have (security token)
    - Something you are (biometric data)
3. **OAuth**: A token-based authentication protocol for third-party access.
4. **SSO (Single Sign-On)**: Allows users to log in once and access multiple systems.

### Best Practices
- Enforce strong password policies.
- Use MFA wherever possible.
- Store passwords securely using hashing algorithms like bcrypt.
- Regularly audit and monitor authentication logs.

## Authorization
Authorization determines what actions or resources a user is permitted to access after they have been authenticated.

### Types of Authorization
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Permissions are assigned based on roles.
2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Permissions are based on attributes like location, time, or device.
3. **Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)**: Uses policies to define access rules.

### Best Practices
- Follow the principle of least privilege.
- Regularly review and update access controls.
- Use centralized access management systems.
- Log and monitor access attempts.

## Key Differences
| Aspect            | Authentication                     | Authorization                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Purpose            | Verifies identity                  | Determines access permissions     |
| When It Happens    | Before granting access             | After authentication              |
| Example            | Logging in with a password         | Accessing admin-only features     |

## Conclusion
Authentication and authorization work together to secure systems by ensuring only authorized users can access specific resources. Implementing robust practices for both is essential to protect sensitive data and maintain system integrity.
