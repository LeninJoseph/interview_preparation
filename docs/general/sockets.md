# Sockets and WebSockets

## Sockets
A **socket** is an endpoint for sending or receiving data across a computer network. It is a fundamental concept in network programming, enabling communication between devices. Sockets are typically used in client-server architectures and can operate over various protocols, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

### Key Features of Sockets:
- **Connection-Oriented (TCP):** Ensures reliable communication with error checking and retransmission.
- **Connectionless (UDP):** Faster communication without guarantees of delivery.
- **Bidirectional Communication:** Data can flow in both directions between the client and server.
- **Port and IP Address:** Sockets use these to identify endpoints.

### Common Use Cases:
- File transfers
- Chat applications
- Remote procedure calls (RPC)

## WebSockets
**WebSockets** are a protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. Unlike traditional HTTP, WebSockets enable real-time, two-way communication between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server.

### Key Features of WebSockets:
- **Persistent Connection:** Once established, the connection remains open, reducing overhead.
- **Low Latency:** Ideal for real-time applications like gaming or live updates.
- **Event-Driven:** Both client and server can send messages independently.

### Common Use Cases:
- Real-time chat applications
- Live sports updates
- Collaborative tools (e.g., Google Docs)
- Online gaming

### Comparison: Sockets vs. WebSockets
| Feature          | Sockets                     | WebSockets                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Protocol         | TCP/UDP                     | HTTP (Upgraded to WebSocket)|
| Communication    | Low-level                   | High-level                  |
| Use Case         | General networking          | Real-time web applications  |

Both sockets and WebSockets are essential tools for building networked applications, with WebSockets being particularly suited for modern web-based real-time communication.
