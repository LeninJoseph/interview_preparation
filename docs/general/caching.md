# Caching

Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in a temporary storage layer, called a cache, to improve performance and reduce latency. By keeping a copy of the data closer to the application or user, caching minimizes the need to repeatedly fetch the same data from slower storage systems or remote servers.

## Benefits of Caching
- **Improved Performance**: Reduces data retrieval time.
- **Reduced Latency**: Speeds up response times for users.
- **Lower Resource Usage**: Decreases load on backend systems.
- **Scalability**: Helps handle increased traffic efficiently.

## Types of Caching
1. **Client-Side Caching**: Data is cached on the user's device (e.g., browser cache).
2. **Server-Side Caching**: Data is cached on the server (e.g., in-memory caches like Redis or Memcached).
3. **CDN Caching**: Content Delivery Networks cache static assets closer to users.

## Common Use Cases
- Web page caching for faster load times.
- Database query result caching.
- API response caching.
- Caching computationally expensive operations.

## Challenges
- **Cache Invalidation**: Ensuring stale data is updated or removed.
- **Cache Consistency**: Keeping cache in sync with the source of truth.
- **Memory Management**: Avoiding excessive memory usage.

Caching is a critical optimization strategy in modern software systems, enabling faster and more efficient applications.
