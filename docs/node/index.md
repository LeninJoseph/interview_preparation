# Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is widely used for building scalable and high-performance server-side applications.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: Node.js uses a non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.
- **Single-Threaded**: It operates on a single-threaded event loop, which can handle multiple concurrent connections.
- **Cross-Platform**: Node.js runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: The npm (Node Package Manager) provides access to thousands of libraries and modules.

## Common Use Cases

- Web servers and APIs
- Real-time applications (e.g., chat apps, gaming)
- Microservices architecture
- Command-line tools

## Example Code

```javascript
// Simple Node.js server
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

## Advantages

- High performance for I/O-intensive tasks
- Large and active community
- Easy to learn for JavaScript developers
