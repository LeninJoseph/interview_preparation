The **Resolver Pattern** is commonly used in **GraphQL APIs**, but its core concept‚Äî**mapping a request to data retrieval logic**‚Äîcan apply more broadly to systems involving **query resolution** or **deferred execution**.

---

## üß© What is the Resolver Pattern?

In simple terms, a **resolver** is a **function that resolves a value** for a field or query. In the **Resolver Pattern**, each field or operation is mapped to a function that knows **how to fetch or compute the data** for it.

This pattern promotes **separation of concerns**:

* **Schemas define the structure**
* **Resolvers define the logic**

---

## üîß Where Is It Used?

* **GraphQL servers** (most common use case)
* **DI containers** (Dependency Resolution)
* **DNS resolvers** (name ‚Üí IP address)
* **Service Locators** (service name ‚Üí implementation)

Here, we‚Äôll focus on the **GraphQL-style Resolver Pattern**, which is most widely used.

## üß¨ GraphQL Resolver Pattern

### 1. **GraphQL Schema**

```graphql
type Query {
    user(id: ID!): User
}

type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    email: String!
}
```

### 2. **Resolvers in Code (JavaScript/TypeScript)**

```js
const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        user: async (_, { id }) => {
            return await getUserById(id);  // You provide this function
        },
    },
    User: {
        email: (user) => {
            // This can do transformations or access controls
            return user.email;
        },
    }
};
```

Each key (like `Query.user`) maps to a **resolver function** that receives:

* `parent`: The parent object (used in nested fields)
* `args`: Arguments passed in the query
* `context`: Shared state or services (e.g., DB access, auth info)
* `info`: Metadata about the query

---

## ‚úÖ Advantages

* **Decouples schema from business logic**
* Allows **fine-grained control** over how data is fetched
* Makes **complex nested queries** possible
* Supports **authorization**, **validation**, and **lazy loading**

---

## ‚ùå Pitfalls

* Can become messy with deeply nested resolvers (e.g., N+1 query problem)
* Without proper optimization, can affect **performance**
* Requires **good error handling** for maintainability

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Resolver Pattern Beyond GraphQL

* **DNS Resolver**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
* **Dependency Injection (DI) Resolver**: Resolves dependencies dynamically from a container.

    ```python
    service = container.resolve('UserService')
    ```
