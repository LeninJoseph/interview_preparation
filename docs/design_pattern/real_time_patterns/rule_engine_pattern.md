# Rule Engine Pattern

The Rule Engine Pattern is a design pattern used to define, manage, and execute business rules or logic independently of the application code. It provides a flexible and scalable way to handle complex decision-making processes by separating the rules from the core application logic.

## Key Concepts

1. **Rules**: Individual pieces of logic or conditions that define specific behaviors or decisions.
2. **Rule Engine**: A component responsible for evaluating and executing the rules.
3. **Facts**: Data or inputs provided to the rule engine for evaluation.
4. **Actions**: Operations performed when a rule is satisfied.

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps business rules separate from application logic, making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.
- **Flexibility**: Rules can be added, modified, or removed without changing the core application code.
- **Reusability**: Rules can be reused across different parts of the application or even in other projects.
- **Scalability**: Handles complex decision-making processes efficiently.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Rules**: Create rules as independent entities, often using a declarative format.
2. **Load Rules**: Load the rules into the rule engine, either from a database, file, or in-memory configuration.
3. **Provide Facts**: Supply the necessary data (facts) to the rule engine.
4. **Evaluate Rules**: The rule engine evaluates the rules against the provided facts.
5. **Execute Actions**: Perform the actions associated with the satisfied rules.

## Example

```python
class Rule:
    def __init__(self, condition, action):
        self.condition = condition
        self.action = action

    def evaluate(self, facts):
        if self.condition(facts):
            self.action(facts)

class RuleEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules = []

    def add_rule(self, rule):
        self.rules.append(rule)

    def execute(self, facts):
        for rule in self.rules:
            rule.evaluate(facts)

# Example usage
def is_adult(facts):
    return facts.get("age", 0) >= 18

def grant_access(facts):
    print("Access granted!")

rule = Rule(is_adult, grant_access)
engine = RuleEngine()
engine.add_rule(rule)

facts = {"age": 20}
engine.execute(facts)
```

## Use Cases

- Fraud detection systems
- Recommendation engines
- Workflow automation
- Access control systems
- Dynamic pricing models

The Rule Engine Pattern is a powerful tool for building systems that require dynamic and adaptable business logic.
