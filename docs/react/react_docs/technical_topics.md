# React JS Technical Topics

## 1. What is React?
<span style="color:blue;">React</span> is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of applications efficiently.

---

## 2. What are Components in React?
<span style="color:green;">Components</span> are the building blocks of a React application. They can be functional or class-based and are used to encapsulate logic and UI.

---

## 3. What is JSX?
<span style="color:purple;">JSX</span> stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript files.

---

## 4. What is State in React?
<span style="color:orange;">State</span> is an object that holds data or information about the component. It is managed within the component and can change over time.

---

## 5. What are Props in React?
<span style="color:red;">Props</span> (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another. They are immutable and read-only.

---

## 6. What is the Virtual DOM?
<span style="color:teal;">Virtual DOM</span> is a lightweight representation of the real DOM. React uses it to optimize updates by comparing changes and updating only the necessary parts of the real DOM.

---

## 7. What are React Hooks?
<span style="color:darkblue;">Hooks</span> are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Examples include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

---

## 8. What is Redux?
<span style="color:brown;">Redux</span> is a state management library often used with React. It provides a centralized store for managing application state.

---

## 9. What is React Router?
<span style="color:darkgreen;">React Router</span> is a library for routing in React applications. It allows navigation between different components or pages without reloading the page.

---

## 10. What is Context API?
<span style="color:darkred;">Context API</span> is a React feature that allows you to share state across components without passing props manually at every level.

---

## 11. What is the difference between Class and Functional Components?
- <span style="color:blue;">Class Components:</span> Use ES6 classes, have lifecycle methods, and manage state with `this.state`.
- <span style="color:green;">Functional Components:</span> Use functions, are stateless by default, and can use hooks for state and lifecycle management.

---

## 12. What is React Fiber?
<span style="color:violet;">React Fiber</span> is the new reconciliation engine in React. It improves rendering performance and allows React to split rendering work into chunks.

---

## 13. What is the use of `useEffect` Hook?
<span style="color:indigo;">`useEffect`</span> is a hook used to perform side effects in functional components, such as fetching data or subscribing to events.

---

## 14. What are Higher-Order Components (HOC)?
<span style="color:gold;">HOCs</span> are functions that take a component and return a new component. They are used for reusing component logic.

---

## 15. What is React Strict Mode?
<span style="color:gray;">Strict Mode</span> is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants.

---

## 16. What is Lazy Loading in React?
<span style="color:cyan;">Lazy Loading</span> is a technique for loading components or resources only when they are needed, improving performance.

---

## 17. What is the difference between Controlled and Uncontrolled Components?
- <span style="color:blue;">Controlled Components:</span> Components where form data is handled by React state.
- <span style="color:green;">Uncontrolled Components:</span> Components where form data is handled by the DOM.

---

## 18. What is React's `key` Prop?
<span style="color:orange;">`key`</span> is a special attribute used to identify elements in a list. It helps React optimize rendering by tracking changes.

---

## 19. What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?
<span style="color:purple;">SSR</span> is the process of rendering React components on the server and sending HTML to the client, improving performance and SEO.

---

## 20. What is the difference between `useState` and `useReducer`?
- <span style="color:blue;">`useState`:</span> Used for managing simple state.
- <span style="color:green;">`useReducer`:</span> Used for managing complex state logic.

---

## 21. What is React.memo?
<span style="color:teal;">React.memo</span> is a higher-order component that prevents unnecessary re-renders by memoizing the component's output.

---

## 22. What is the purpose of `React.Fragment`?
<span style="color:darkblue;">`React.Fragment`</span> is used to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

---

## 23. What is the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`?
- <span style="color:blue;">`useEffect`:</span> Runs after the render is committed to the screen.
- <span style="color:green;">`useLayoutEffect`:</span> Runs synchronously after all DOM mutations.

---

## 24. What is Prop Drilling?
<span style="color:red;">Prop Drilling</span> is the process of passing props through multiple levels of components to reach a deeply nested component.

---

## 25. What is React's Concurrent Mode?
<span style="color:brown;">Concurrent Mode</span> is an experimental feature that allows React to render updates in the background without blocking the main thread.
