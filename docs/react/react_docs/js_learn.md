# JavaScript Basics

### What is the window object?
The `window` object is the global object in a browser environment. It represents the browser window and provides methods, properties, and events for interacting with the browser.

### What is the document object?
The `document` object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser. It allows access to and manipulation of the DOM (Document Object Model).

### What is a variable scope in JavaScript?
Variable scope determines where a variable is accessible. JavaScript has three types of scope:
- **Global Scope**: Accessible everywhere.
- **Function Scope**: Accessible only within the function.
- **Block Scope**: Accessible only within a block (`{}`), introduced with `let` and `const`.

### What is a closure?
A closure is a function that retains access to its outer scope, even after the outer function has executed.

```javascript
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}
const counter = outer();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

### What is coercion in JavaScript?
Coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one type to another, such as converting a string to a number.

```javascript
console.log('5' - 2); // 3 (string '5' is coerced to number)
```

### What is the temporal dead zone?
The temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the period between the declaration of a variable (using `let` or `const`) and its initialization, during which accessing the variable results in a `ReferenceError`.

### What is hoisting in JavaScript?
Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during compilation.

### What is the difference between function expression and function declaration?
- **Function Declaration**: Defined using the `function` keyword and hoisted.
- **Function Expression**: Assigned to a variable and not hoisted.

```javascript
// Function Declaration
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello');
}

// Function Expression
const greet = function() {
  console.log('Hello');
};
```

### What is a callback?
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function and executed later.

```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback('Data fetched');
  }, 1000);
}
fetchData(console.log);
```

### What is setTimeout?
`setTimeout` is a function that executes a callback after a specified delay.

```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log('Hello after 1 second'), 1000);
```

### What is the event loop in JavaScript?
The event loop is a mechanism that handles asynchronous operations by managing the call stack, callback queue, and microtask queue.

### What is the difference between microtask and macrotask (callback) queues?
- **Microtasks**: Include Promises and `MutationObserver`. They have higher priority.
- **Macrotasks**: Include `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and I/O tasks.

### Why does a Promise run before setTimeout?
Promises are part of the microtask queue, which has higher priority than the macrotask queue where `setTimeout` resides.

### What is the output of this tricky async code? (ðŸ†• Practice question)
```javascript
console.log('Start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout'), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Promise'));
console.log('End');
```
**Output**:
```
Start
End
Promise
Timeout
```

### What is a promise?
A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

### What is callback hell?
Callback hell refers to nested callbacks that make code difficult to read and maintain.

### What is .reduce() in JavaScript?
`.reduce()` is an array method that reduces an array to a single value by applying a callback function.

```javascript
const sum = [1, 2, 3].reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
console.log(sum); // 6
```

### What are .map() and .filter()? How are they different?
- **`.map()`**: Transforms each element in an array and returns a new array.
- **`.filter()`**: Filters elements based on a condition and returns a new array.

### What is the difference between .map() and .forEach()?
- **`.map()`**: Returns a new array.
- **`.forEach()`**: Executes a function for each element but does not return a new array.

### What are template literals?
Template literals allow embedding expressions in strings using backticks (`` ` ``).

```javascript
const name = 'John';
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
```

### What is the difference between == and ===?
- `==`: Compares values after type coercion.
- `===`: Compares values without type coercion.

### What is currying in JavaScript?
Currying is a technique of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.

```javascript
const add = (a) => (b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2)(3)); // 5
```

### Deep copy using recursion â€“ how to implement it?
```javascript
function deepCopy(obj) {
  if (obj === null || typeof obj !== 'object') return obj;
  const copy = Array.isArray(obj) ? [] : {};
  for (const key in obj) {
    copy[key] = deepCopy(obj[key]);
  }
  return copy;
}
```

### String manipulation in JavaScript
JavaScript provides methods like `split()`, `replace()`, `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, and `substring()` for string manipulation.

### What is void in JavaScript?
The `void` operator evaluates an expression and returns `undefined`.

```javascript
void 0; // undefined
```

# JavaScript Intermediate Topics

### What is event bubbling and capturing?
- **Bubbling**: Events propagate from the target element to the root.
- **Capturing**: Events propagate from the root to the target element.

### What is event delegation?
Event delegation is a technique where a parent element handles events for its child elements using event bubbling.

### What is debouncing?
Debouncing limits the rate at which a function executes by delaying its execution until after a specified time has elapsed since the last call.

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}
```

### What is throttling?
Throttling ensures a function is executed at most once in a specified time interval.

```javascript
function throttle(func, limit) {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return function (...args) {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= limit) {
      lastCall = now;
      func.apply(this, args);
    }
  };
}
```

### Compare debouncing and throttling.
- **Debouncing**: Delays execution until a pause in events.
- **Throttling**: Limits execution to once per interval.

### What is the timer queue?
The timer queue is where macrotasks like `setTimeout` and `setInterval` are queued for execution.

### What are localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies?
- **localStorage**: Stores data with no expiration.
- **sessionStorage**: Stores data for the session.
- **Cookies**: Stores small amounts of data with expiration and sent with HTTP requests.

### What is a web worker?
A web worker is a script that runs in the background, separate from the main thread, to perform tasks without blocking the UI.

### What is a service worker?
A service worker is a script that intercepts network requests and enables offline capabilities, caching, and push notifications.

### What is the difference between web worker and service worker?
- **Web Worker**: For background tasks.
- **Service Worker**: For network-related tasks and offline support.

### What is a heap and stack in JavaScript?
- **Heap**: Memory for objects and dynamic allocation.
- **Stack**: Memory for function calls and execution context.

### What is a currying function?
A currying function transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.

### What is the scope chain?
The scope chain is the hierarchy of scopes used to resolve variable references.

# ES6 and Modern JavaScript Features

### What are the main ES6 features?
- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Destructuring
- Spread/rest operators
- Classes
- Promises
- Modules

### What is an arrow function?
An arrow function is a concise syntax for writing functions. It does not have its own `this`.

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

### What are default parameters in ES6? ðŸ†•
Default parameters allow setting default values for function arguments.

```javascript
function greet(name = 'Guest') {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
}
```

### What is destructuring in JavaScript? ðŸ†•
Destructuring allows unpacking values from arrays or objects into variables.

```javascript
const [a, b] = [1, 2];
const { name } = { name: 'John' };
```

### What is the spread operator? ðŸ†•
The spread operator (`...`) expands an array or object.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const newArr = [...arr, 4];
```

### What are rest parameters? ðŸ†•
Rest parameters (`...`) collect arguments into an array.

```javascript
function sum(...nums) {
  return nums.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
```
